# punctaTracking
Basic code to detect local maximas in a signal and to quantify their abundance. A potential application is identification of stress granules.

We will be using a virtual environment called "punctaTracking" which is included in this repository as puncta.yml

Install virtual environment file using:
conda env create --name punctaTracking -f puncta.yml

Create a kernel to run virtual environment in jupyter using: python -m ipykernel install --user --name=punctaTracking

Use workbook '231215_stressgranule_quant-toshare.ipynb' to play with data
